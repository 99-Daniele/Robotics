# Robotics Project

This project involves utilizing the ROS (Robot Operating System) framework to simulate robot movements.

After installing and configuring ROS on Ubuntu Linux, our team began implementing the project using C++.

By using wheel kinematics as input, we calculated the robot's linear and angular velocity through various physics formulas.

With the robot's velocity known, we reconstructed its position on the x and y axes at each moment.

Finally, we evaluated the accuracy of the simulation by comparing it with actual recorded data, recalibrating through fine-tuning variable parameters to enhance precision.
